# HAL Research Briefs (Private)

Private research briefs generated from HAL's openclaw-trace runs.
Contains ticket numbers, Phorge references, and internal context.

**Do NOT publish without PII scrub + expansion.**

To prepare for public sharing:
1. Strip ticket numbers (T###)
2. Replace Phorge-specific context with generic descriptions
3. Expand abbreviated references to full explanations
4. Run PII redaction pass
5. Move to `docs/research-briefs/` in the public repo
